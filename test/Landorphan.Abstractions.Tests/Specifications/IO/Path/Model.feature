Feature: windows Pre-parse conversions
	In order to develop a reliable Windows Path parser 
	As a member of the Landorphan Team
	I want to to be able to convert incoming paths into a more managable form

Scenario: Windows Preparse converter creates managable strings for the tokenizer
	Given I have done nothing
	 When I do nothing
	 Then nothing should occur
