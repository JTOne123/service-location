PokerPro.Std.sln is a side by side .Net Standard collection of production projects in parallel with PokerPro.Core.sln
Microsoft does not offer a .Net Standard test project type, so all test projects in this solution are full Net Framework test projects.
In addtional, the parallel projects Landorphan.TestUtilities.NoIoc.NetFx and Landorphan.TestUtilities.WithIoc.NetFx are full Net Framework projets, parallel to their core counterpart projects.
