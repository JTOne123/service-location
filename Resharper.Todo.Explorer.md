# 2 custom TODO items are added to solution Resharper settings.
REFACTOR: is intended to be used mid-refactor and should be removed before checking into master or develop.  It is flagged as an error in TODO explorer.

NEIN: German for 'no' is intended to flag kludges, convoluted code, and other constructs that should be cleaned up.  It is flagged as a warning in TODO explorer.

WBN:  Would be nice.  Flag for code areas that should be improved.
